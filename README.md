# Background-GIF
DO NOT USE THIS. CPU USAGE WAY TOO EXTREME. Sets a "gif" as your background image on Macs.

(Technically doesn't set your background as a gif. Instead I converted a gif into it's sub-frames and it sets your backgroun as each of the frames by looping through them all).

Here is a gif of my Desktop background being a "gif"
